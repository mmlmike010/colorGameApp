# colorGameApp
Try to guess the correct color based of a randomly generated RGB sequence by clicking on the square of choice. If you choose incorrectly, the square will disappear, and you will have to guess from the remainder of choices. If you choose the right color, the entire screen will light up with the color selected.

Play as much as you want! Users can select from easy mode to hard mode.
